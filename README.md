# Netflix Clone

Excited? So am I.

React Topics covered in this basic app:

# 1) State and Props
A must have basic information, no matter what.

# 2) Hooks
Just simple functions which have functionalities and are prefixed by "use" keyword. These hooks are very handy and near to essential to use for clean and efficient code when stepping into functional components.

You can even design your own custom hooks too. 

# 3) Styled Components
A simple way to add styling to your component without getting of it. 

# 4) Axios
An alternate library to likes of Fetch API and alike to access 3rd Party APIs. It's simple to learn and quite easy to use in your project.

# 5) YouTube and movie-trailer modules
Modules which let me access the trailers from the youtube and show in my Netflix Clone Web Application. Movie trailer takes name as an input and returns some ID. 
This ID is then passed into the YouTube "videoId" props to access the respective trailer from its database.

# 6) Using 3rd Party API - TMDB (The Movie DataBase)
TMDB is just another 3rd Party API which gives you access to recent popular trailers. These trailers are divided into their respective genres.
